## Password Manager


Simple password manager written in Python to add, hold, update, remove, list passwords for different services

This was an individual project that was completed during my first few days on the Makers bootcamp. The three files show the iterations of the programme through increasing complexity / functionality.

My aim for the project was to keep my code as asimple and efficient as possible and to use list and dictionary comprehension where possible.
